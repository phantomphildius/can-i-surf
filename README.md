# [wip] can i surf?

An application designed to answer a simple question many desk jockeys ask themselves daily, "Can I surf today?". This app intends to solve this by allowing a user to select where they are and their available time window for that day and receive a few best bets given the parameters. Along with those best bets, you will receive other important information like an ideal board, wetsuit, and a more detailed forecast for a location. Ideally this takes most of the guess work out of deciding when and where to surf for those poor souls who only have a few minutes to get in the water. For ease of access, this will bee designed with a mobile browser in mind. That being said, I don't intend to share this out too much to avoid crowding spots.

## Navigating the repo

This repo contains the server side (server directory) and client side (client directory) code.

## Surf forecasting data

The data used to power this application is from [Magic Seaweed's public api](https://magicseaweed.com/docs/developers/59/api/9905/).

## About the author

I am an [engineering manager](https://github.com/phantomphildius/manager-readme) at [Betterment](https://betterment.com). I miss coding daily, writing typescript, and surfing everyday. This project is intended to help me scratch at least one of these itches at a time.
